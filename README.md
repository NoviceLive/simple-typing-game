Simple-Typing-Game
==================

A simple, rough and fragile .NET typing game.

Frankly, all its value is just memory.

It was developed under Visual Studio 2013 CLR via C++ 
(This took me some efforts searching on Google for a solution of writing .NET application via C++ under either VS2012 or VS2013.)
In order to gain overall aquaintance of .NET framework as much as possible merely through these simple codes
(I have no idea to further my .NET knowledge, say, I will not write .NET apps in the future), 
using statement was completely abandoned.
Therefore, ^_^, don't wonder why there are abundant :: tokens.
